# MTA-DayZ-Base-System
Simple script for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas to spawn base. This script was written in 2017 and worked perfectly with MTA:SA 1.5.4 version, be aware that can be some bugs if you use newer MTASA version. You need admin group (in ACL) to use commands.


# Available commands

  - /addBase [Base Name] [Group Name]
  - /showbasenames
  - /changebasegroup
  - /nearbybases
  - /deletebase [ID]
  - /gotobase [ID]
  - /listallbases
  - /exitbase
